MySQL Program Guide
I made 9 tables to represent a cable company with the different types of packages a customer can purchase, 10 different channels and 4 shows per channel.
i had to make 6 querys to a program guide for a specfic date, a guide for a specific package, a query for a payment notice, a query to show the customers who have paid and those who havent, a count of every customers favorite channel and a query to show how many total packages have been sold with the total sale amount
